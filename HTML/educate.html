                <img style="width: 50%; align-self: center;" src="\images\urban heat island.jfif" alt="map of urban heat islands">
                 <p style="color:white; margin-left: 10px;">More than half of Seattle residents live in urban heat islands. Urban heat islands are places where temperatures can be around 8 degrees higher than surrounding areas. Paved roads, parking lots, and buildings can absorb heat and release it back into the air. This causes an increase in weather related deaths, air pollution and greenhouse gas emmisions.</p>

                <p style="color:white; margin-left: 10px;">With an increase in storms due to climate change, the storm water washes pollutants such as motor oil, pesticides, metals, fertilizer, pet waste and more, into bodies of water. This harms animals that live in the water, like the native salmon and southern resident orcas.</p>

                <p style="color: white; margin-left: 10px;">To stop climate change, Seattle has enacted the Green New Deal resolution which tells all city officials to work together to make a positive impact on the planet. The resolution's goal is to create a smooth transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, new jobs, and prioritize communities that are most impacted by climate change, economic and racial injustice.</p>

                 <p style="color:white; margin-left: 10px;">Some communities are more impacted by climate change than others. For example, people of color are more likely to live near polluted areas, have health problems related to the environment, and have less access to afordable housing, nutritious food and open space. To remedy this, Seattle founded the Equity and Environment Agenda, which tries to ensure that all communities are benefiting from the solutions made to help the environment.</p>

                <p style="color:white; margin-left: 10px;">Recently the temperature lows have reached a record high, with the greatest increases happening during the summer months. The Earth's surface cools at night, and releases heat back into the air, but some of the heat is trapped in the green house gases, which is what causes the temperature to increase.</p>

                <p style="color: white; margin-left: 10px;">The Climate Action Strategy is designed to reduce the amount of transportation emissions in Seattle and the building energy emissions. It will do this by building more electric car charging stations in parking lots, increasing transit in underserved communities, changing building codes to decrease emissions and more.</p>

                 <p style="color:white; margin-left: 10px;"> New infrastructure is always being built which has a very big impact on biodversity. When land is developed the animals living on that land experience a change in migration patterns, habitat aleration and exposure to invasive species. </p>

                <p style="color:white; margin-left: 10px;">Invasive species are usually not native to Seattle, and are very competitive. They are difficult to manage and eliminate, and can be damageing to native species or plant and animal resources in Seattle.</p>

                <p style="color: white; margin-left: 10px;">Climate change has many negative impacts on biodiversity. For example, there is an increase in heat related deaths in the animals, change in food webs, change is growth, biological invasions, diseases and more.</p>
